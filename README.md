Programming Languages


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project reads the items that are purchased in one day from a store that are stored in a text document. With the options to view all the items that were sold for the day, count the number of times a specific item was bought, or generate a text graph of how many times an item was purchased for a given day. The problem that it solved was before a user would have to manually read the list of items, then perform any analysis. 

### What did you do particularly well?
One thing that I did particularly well was the ability to create reusable code. The python code is organized into various functions that can be reused in other functions to achieve various outcomes. 

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think an enhancement to my code could be in Source.cpp. I think if I loaded the file data in cpp and then passed to the python code it will eliminate the need to load into python every time a function is called. 

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the most challenging part of the project was getting the Python code properly set up. To make this possible to me, I utilized Stack Overflow and other guides to work through the issues. 

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills regarding memory management and how various programming languages store values and objects in memory will be paramount to my career as a software engineer. 

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through the use of comments in my source code, having appropiate named variables and functions. The code was written with the concept of being able to read the variable and function names then knowing what they are intended for.
