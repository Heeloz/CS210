### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project reads the items that are purchased in one day from a store that are stored in a text document. With the options to view all the items that were sold for the day, count the number of times a specific item was bought, or generate a text graph of how many times an item was purchased for a given day. The problem that it solved was before a user would have to manually read the list of items, then perform any analysis. 

### What did you do particularly well?
One thing that I did particularly well was the ability to create reusable code. The python code is organized into various functions that can be reused in other functions to achieve various outcomes. 

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?


### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
